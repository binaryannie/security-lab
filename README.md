# Security Lab

This project is a simple Vagrant based security lab. It's a quick and easy way
to spawn VMs to exploit and play with.

The beauty of this project is that it works on Linux, Mac & Windows through the
power of virtual machines and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

## Setup

First, make sure that you have the prerequisites.

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- A Hypervisor

  Vagrant supports a [few hypervisors](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/)
  (they call them providers).

  I recommend [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This is what I test &
  develop this project with and I find that the community that provides vagrant
  boxes usually supports VirtualBox.

Second, download the content of this repo. You can either clone it with `git` or
download the source code archive through Github.

## Usage
